# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project implements fraud detection techniques using the Credit Card Fraud dataset from Kaggle.

## Techniques Implemented

## Dataset

The dataset contains credit card transactions made in September 2013 by European cardholders. It presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, with the positive class (frauds) accounting for 0.172% of all transactions.
